  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Intro: Create a Movie Website</h3>
    <p>Learn to use other people's code to save time an effort!</p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Lesson 0: Introduction to Abstraction</h3>
    <p>Start by using functions, then learn about classes and Object Oriented Programming</p>
  
  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Lesson 1: Use Functions</h3>
    <p><b>Take a Break (<a href="break_time.py">relevant .py</a>)</b>
    <br>Write Python script that opens a browser and plays your favorite song/video every 2 hours, prompting you to take a break</p>
    <p>We want our program to:
      <ol>
        <li>Wait 2 hours
        <p>Google how to do this! Found on Stackoverflow.com:
          <div class="Code">
            <p>import time</p>
            <p>time.sleep(10) """ 10 = 10 seconds """</p>
          </div></li>
        <li>Open browser
        <p>Google how to do this! Found:
          <div class="Code">
            <p>import webbrowser</p>
            <p>webbrowser.open("http://whatever.com")</p>
          </div></li>
        <li>Repeat these steps 3x in a loop
            <br>See .py for how I solved this</li>
      </ol></p>

      <p><b>Where Does Webbrowser Come From?</b>
      <br>Inside Python (that we downloaded) is a file or module called webbroswer</p>
      <p>Inside that is a function called open</p>
      <p>Same for file called time that contains a variety of useful functions
      <br>including <span class="inline_code">ctime</span> which tells us the current time, and <span class="inline_code">sleep</span> which suspends program for a little bit</p>
      <p>How do these work? The details are hidden from us, i.e. <b>abstraction</b>. Allows us to focus on the program we want to write and use more complex functions simply by reading their documentation! </p>
      <p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html">Python Standard Library</a> explains built-in Python features and their parameters, etc.</p>
      <p>Secret Message program (<a href="secret_message.py">relevant .py</a>)
      <br>Renames files!</p>
      <p>We want our program to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Get all the file names
            <p>Google "find filenames in a folder in Python"</p>
              <p><span class="inline_code">os.listdir()</span> will get you everything that's in a directory - files and directories
              <br>module in Python called os (for operating system) that contains a function listdir which lists everything in a given directory</p>
              <p>takes in a file path and returns list of strings of the filenames:</p>
                <div class="Code">
                  <p>import os</p>
                  <p>os.listdir(r"C:\Users\bjerickson\Desktop\prank")</p>
                </div></li>
          <li>For each file, rename it!
            <p>Look through <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html">documentation for os module</a>, which function can we use to rename files? <span class="inline_code">rename()</span>, it takes in 'source' or current name of the file and changes it to 'destination' or new name</p>
            <p>use <span class="inline_code">translate</span> function that operates on strings and takes up to 2 arguments: a table which translates one set of characters to another, since we don't have that, we simply input 'None'. The other parameter is a list of characters to remove.</p>
            <p><span class="inline_code">os.getcwd()</span> retrieves current working directory (cwd)</p>
            <p><span class="inline_code">os.chdir()</span> changes working directory</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>What would happen if:
          <br>We try to rename a file that does not exist?
          <br>We try to rename a file to a name that already exists in the folder?</p>
        <p>In both cases we will get an error called an <b>Exception</b> (we will revisit this idea later!)</p>
        <p><b>When Functions Do Not Suffice</b></p>
        <p>Define a <b>template</b> and record all of the data that needs to go into that template (e.x. make a separate .py for each movie). Instead, define a generic template and then say each movie is a type of that template, etc. --> <b>classes!</b></p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Lesson 2: Use Classes</h3>
    <p><b>Draw Turtles (<a href="drawing_turtles.py">relevant .py</a>)</b></p>
    <p>Inside Python Standard Library is a file/module called turtle (lowercase) and inside that is a class Turtle (uppercase)</p>
    <p>A class is a "neatly packaged box that puts things together really well"</p>
    <p>In .py: Turtle is a class, and brad, angie, and thomas are instances of that class
    <br><b>class</b> kind of like a blueprint that can be used to build multiple buildings
    <br><b>instances</b> or <b>objects</b> are like individual buildings made from that blueprint</p>
    <p><b>Turtle-Mini Project</b>: draw a flower, fractals, or your initials!
    <br><a href="turtle_mini_project.py">relevant .py</a></p>
    
    <p><b>Send Text (<a href="send_text.py">relevant .py</a>)</b></p>
    <p>Write a program that sends text messages (cool!)</p>
    <p><b>Twilio</b> is a Python package that sends text messages, but it does <em>not</em> come with the Python Standard Library! One of thousands that you can download and install. To do this: type <span class="inline_code">easy_install twilio</span> into CLI and hit enter (that's it!)</p>
    <p>Python's <span class="inline_code">from</span> statement allowss you to import specific attributes from a module, e.x.:</p>
    <div class="Code">
      <p>from module_name import something</p>
      <p>from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient</p>
    </div>
    <p>For the second example above we are saying inside the folder "twilio" there is a folder called "rest" and inside that is a Python file with a class called "TwilioRestClient"</p>
    <p>Remember that you call upon functions and classes in pretty much the same way (syntax-wise) because when you call a class what you are really doing is calling the <span class="inline_code">__init__</span> function within that class. This creates an instance that you can assign to a variable.</p>

    <p><b>Profanity Editor (<a href="profanity_editor.py">relevant .py</a>)</b></p>
    <p>Steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read text from a document
          <p><span class="inline_code">open</span> function allows us to read the contents of a file. Returns an object of the file type. Syntax: <span class="inline_code">variable_name = open(file_location)</span></p>
          <p><span class="inline_code">read</span> function is used next, syntax: <span class="inline_code">file_contents = variable_name.read()</span></p>
          <p>Is is important to remember to close a file when you are done with it, syntax: <span class="inline_code">file_contents.close()</span></p></li>
        <li>Check text for curse words
          <p><a href="http://www.wdyl.com">What do you love?</a> is a website that will help us filter out curse words</p>
          <p>Use <span class="inline_code">urllib</span> and <span class="inline_code">urlopen</span> (and close) to open a website using Python. <span class="inline_code">urllib</span> "helps us get data from websites"</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    <p><a href="explore_built-in_functions.py">Explore built-in functions mini-assignment</a></p>
    <p>Connecting Ideas!</p>
    <p>In all three examples above, we created instances/objects and then used those objects, e.x.:</p>
      <div class="Code">
        <p>brad = turtle.Turtle()
          <br>brad.forward(100)</p>
        <p>quotes = open(file)
          <br>quotes.read()</p>
        <p>connection = urllib.urlopen()
          <br>connection.read()</p>
      </div>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Lesson 3: Make Classes</h3>
    <p><b>Movie Website (<a href="media.py">relevant .py</a>, <a href="entertainment_center.py">another relevant .py</a>)</b></p>
    <p>Use classes to build it! Create a class called Movie and decide what it should remember (e.x. title, storyline, poster image, link you Youtube trailer)</p>
    <p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google Style Guide for Python</a> is full of useful information!!
    <br>e.x. class names should be capitalized</p>
    <p>Put class defintions in one file and then call the class in another file</p>
    <p>New vocab words:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class
        <p>Can have both data and methods</p>
      </li>
      <li>Instance
        <p>Versions of a class</p>
      </li>
      <li>Constructor
        <p>When we create an instance of a class the class' constructor gets called which is essentially the <span class="inline_code">__init__</span> method inside the class.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Self</li>
        <p>The constructor uses the keyword <span class="inline_code">self</span> which refers to the instance in question</p>
      <li>Instance Variables</li>
        <p>Variables associated with a specific instance as defined within <span class="inline_code">__init__</span>. They are unique to an object and can be accessed using the <span class="inline_code">self</span> keyword inside the class or the instance name outside of the class</p>
      <li>Instance methods
        <p>All of the functions inside the class that are associated with an instance and have the first argument as <span class="inline_code">self</span>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is nicely summarized here:</p>
    <img src="class_vocab_words.png" alt="Screenshot from 'Recap Vocab' video">
    <p>When creating a new class we define an <span class="inline_code">__init__</span> function which tells Python to create space in memory to remember details for our new class
    <br>It is a good idea to include <span class="inline_code">self</span> as a parameter in your <span class="inline_code">__init__</span> function! It is kind of like a generic placeholder name for the new instance you create and isn't <em>really</em> counted as a parameter. It is used to define <b>instance variables</b> inside the <span class="inline_code">__init__</span> function of your new class</p>
    <p><b>Advanced ideas in Object Oriented Programming</b></p>
    <p><b>Class variables</b> are associated with all instances of a class and are not specific to just one instance they can be accessed like this:</p>
    <div class="Code">
      <p>python_filename.Class_name.variable_name</p>
      <p>media.Movie.valid_ratings</p>
    </div>
    <p>When you define a variable that is essentially a constant, Google Style Guide suggests you use all caps, e.x.: <span class="inline_code">VALID_RATINGS = ["G", "PG", "PG-13", "R"]</span></p>
    <p>All classes come with preexisting class variables, e.x. <span class="inline_code">__doc__</span> which holds some documentation. If you define your own class this refers to the """ comments at the start of your class</p>
    <div class="Code">
      <p>class Movie():
        """ The information you type here = __doc__ """</p>
    </div>
    <p>Can be accessed the same way as class variables above</p>
    <p>Other predefined variables include <span class="inline_code">__name__</span> which refers to the name of the class (e.x. Movie) and <span class="inline_code">__module__</span> which refers to the name of the file in which the class was defined (e.x. media)</p>
    <p><b>Inheritance (<a href="inheritance.py">relevant .py</a>)</b></p>
    <p>One class can inherit variables from another</p>
    <p><b>Updating Class Movie (<a href="media2.py">relevant .py</a>)</b></p>
    <p>When a class inherits from another class, they also inherit any functions/methods. However, you can write a method with the same name in the 'child' class (or subclass) and override the 'parent' class method (i.e. <b>method overriding</b>.</p>
