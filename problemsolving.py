# Problem 1-1
# Define a procedure, find_last, that takes as input two strings, a search string and a target string, and returns the last position in the search string where the target string appears, or -1 if there are no occurrences. Example: find_last('aaaa', 'a') returns 3. Make sure your procedure has a return statement.

# Problem 1-2

# If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

# the answer is 21124
