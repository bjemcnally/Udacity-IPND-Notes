<h2 class="NotesTitle">Get Ready for Stage 2</h2>
  <p>Concepts, Tools, and setting up workspace...</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Interview with Mike Wales</h2>
  <p>Being comfortable makes everything easier and more efficient</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">How to Install Python (Windows)</h2>
  <p>This program uses Python 2 :( oh well...
  <p>Re-installed Python 2.7 to make sure I have everything set properly for this course</p>
  <p>Will run my Python files via Powershell:
    cd\

    then

    cd LearnPython\Udacity\Stage-2\

    then python filename.py
    </p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Setting Up Your Workspace (1 and 2)</h2>
  <p>You can download a "package" to enable a feature similar to "Build" in Sublime in your code editor or choice... or just use the command line (I'll do this)</p>
  <p>To use <b>Code Runner</b> in Visual Studio Code, press Control+Alt+N, to stop running code press Control+Alt+M</p>
  <p>Use # symbol to add notes in Python</p>
  <p>Get in habit of running code this way!</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">The Command Line</h2>
  <p><b>Git Bash</b>
    <br>MinTTY requires command line to be written like this:
    <br>$ winpty python file_name.py
    <br><b>Don't forget this!!</b>
    <br><br>Also: Windows users need to use <b>start</b> command instead of <b>open</b> to open a file in its default program.</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Navigating Directories with a GUI</h2>
  <p><b>Graphical User Interface (GUI or "gwee")</b> - visual way of interacting with computer with windows, buttons, mouse, etc.</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">CLI (Navigating, etc.)</h2>
  <p><b>Command Line Interface (CLI)</b> - e.x. Terminal, Git Bash, Powershell, etc.
    <ul>
      <li><b>pwd = print working directory</b>, "where am I?", will print out path to current directory (what GUI calls a folder)
        <br>When CLI is first opened it starts in the <b>home directory</b> (in my case this is C:/Users/bjerickson)</li>
      <li><b>ls = list</b>, helps us view the contents of a directory</li>
      <li><b>start</b>, use "start ." to view current directory's contents in a window, or use "start directory_name" to open another directory (folder)</li>
      <li><b>cd = change directories</b>, used to "move" somewhere else, "cd Desktop" will move to Desktop directory (folder) if it's within current directory, "cd .." will move up one directory, "cd" will return to home directory, "cd FolderA/FolderAb/FolderAbC" can accomplish several steps at once (this is referred to as "chaining" the directories together)</li>
      <li><b>mkdir = make directory</b> ("make-dur" or "make-deer"), creates a new folder with the name we provide: "mk dir animals" will make new folder called animals
        <br>to make folder "rodents" inside of "animals":
        <br> cd into animals than mkdir rodents
        <br>OR from Desktop, "mkdir animals/rodents"
        <p>to make several new directories, separate them with a space: "mkdir cats dogs marsupials"
          <br>for this reason, <b>it is not a good idea to put spaces in your directory or filenames!!</b></li>
      <li><b>touch</b>, creates new files in one step, ex "touch first_file.txt" will create brand new, empty text file, you can verify that it was made using ls, can make a file in a directory other than current directory by specifying filepath (as with ls and cd), and to create multiple files separate with spaces (as with mkdir)</li>
      <li><b>rm</b> is used to delete a file completely (not move it to the trash), can delete multiple files by separating names with spaces as before</li>
      <li>There are two ways to remove directories:
        <br><b>rmdir</b>, "rmdir directory_name" deletes a directory, but only works if it's empty
        <br><b>rm -rf (be careful with this one!), deletes a non-empty directory where -rf = recursive force, this is potentially very dangerous!!!!!!!</b></li>
      <li><b>Remember that to run a Python file in Git Bash you must include winpty:
            "winpty python file_name.py"</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A summary of these new commands can be found <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345403/modules/356813882475460/lessons/4137319262/concepts/63975772210923">here</a>.</p>
    
<h2 class="NotesTitle">Ready, Set, Go!</h2>
  <p>From here on, workspace = browser, code editor, and terminal (Git Bash or other)</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Welcome to Stage 2</h2>
  <p>We will make a MadLibs games</p>
    
<h2 class="NotesTitle">Why You'll Make It</h2>
  <p>Learn to use "variables", to write "functions", and to think like a programmer</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">How You'll Make It</h2>
  <p>Using Lessons 2.1-2.7 and the subsequent Work Session</p>
  <p><b>From here on, instead of naming each subsection individually, I will name the larger sections and just link directly to parts that are tricky or that I may need to review</b></p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Introduction to Serious Programming</h2>
  <p>Computer Science is about how to solve problems via a precise set of steps
    <br>"Crawling webpages" finds data, starts from "seed" page to find links to other pages which can themselves have links to other pages, etc.</p>
  <p><b>What is programming?</b>, the core of computer science, to change a toaster's behavior you'd have to mechanically alter it, computers can't do anything without a program, it tells the computer what to do (and it can do any computation!), program must be a very precise sequence of steps, but computer can exute those steps VERY quickly</p>
  <p><b>Python</b>, named for Monty Python, high level language, Python code runs via Python program (interpreter)</p>
  <p><b>Remember that Control+Alt+N will run code</b></p>
  <p>Took notes for <b>First Programming Quiz</b> in Python file which can be viewed <a href="first-programming-quiz.py">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Why do we need to invent new languages to program computers instead of using natural languages (like English or Mandarin)?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ambiguity in natural languages (e.x. biweekly can mean every other week AND twice a week = ambiguous!)</li>
      <li>Verbosity, code minimizes number of necessary characters</li>
    </ul>
  <p>getting a syntax error indicates that your script contains something that is not part of the python language</p>
  <p><b>Grammar</b> (more notes on this section can be found <a href="grammar.py">here</a>)
        <br>English: sentence = subject, verb, object
        <br>subject and object can be nouns, etc
        <br>Languages have rules and parts of speech, etc</p>
  <p><b>Backus Naur Form</b>
    <br>precisely describe language in simple and concise way
    <br>Non-terminal --> replacement
    <br>replacement can be non-terminal or terminal and you keep replacing until you reach terminals:
    <br>Sentence --> Subject Verb Object
    <br>Subject --> Noun
    <br>Object --> Noun
    <br>Verb --> Eat
    <br>Verb --> Like
    <br>Noun --> I
    <br>Noun --> Python
    <br>Noun --> Cookies
    <br><br><b>Derivation</b> starts from non-terminal and follows rules until we have only terminals left
    <br>Valid outputs for above include: "I Eat Cookies" and "Python Like Python", etc.</p>
  <p>Python grammar is much stricter than most natural language grammars
    <br>Code must match language grammar exactly (see <a href="python-expression.py">here</a> for an example of bad Python grammar)</p>
  <p>Python Grammar for Arithmetic Expression:
    <br>Expression --> Expression Operator Expression (recursive definition, resulting in an infinite number of possible outcomes/derivations)
    <br>Expression --> Number
    <br>Operator --> +
    <br>Operator --> *
    <br>Number --> 0, 1, ... etc
    <br>Expression --> (Expression)
    <br>An example derivation can result in: 1 + 1 and/or replacing expressions with expressions can increase complexity infinitely!
    <br>A few simple rules (like above) can be used to describe a big language!</p>
  <p>Speed of Light Quiz (associated Python <a href="speed-of-light.py">here</a>)
    <br>Write Python code to print out how far light travels in cm in one nanosecond...
    <br>For one billion (1,000,000,000) or whatever, Python does not allow spaces (1 000 000 000) or the commas, must use 1000000000
    <br>Note: if all numbers provided are integers Python will return an integer, to get decimals include at least one decimal place in your calculation (1.0 vs just 1)</p>
  <p>Grace Hopper
    <br>Compiler, a program that writes other programs</p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Work Session 1</h2>
  <p>Debugging practice: Notes
    <br>"print 1" is valid
    <br>" print 1" is NOT valid
    <br>Python will interpret "print &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1" the same as "print 1"
    <br>"Print 1" is NOT valid
    <br>Takeaway: <em>the trick to dealing with mistakes in code ("bugs") is not to avoid making them entirely, but to develop a system for finding and fixing them!</em></p>

<h2 class="NotesTitle">Variables and Strings</h2>
  <p>Where to Focus Your Attention</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What is a variable?</li>
      <li>What does it mean to assign a value to a variable</li>
      <li>What is the difference between = in math versus programming? i.e. what is the difference between 2 + 3 = 5 and my_variable = 5?</li>
    </ol>
  <p>Variables and Varying Variables (Python and more notes <a href="variables.py">here</a>, including quiz questions and answers)
    <br>Assignment statement: Name = Expression
    <br>Name can be any sequence of letters, numbers, and underscores
    <br>Variables can vary, you can change their value!
    <br>When including a decimal, it does not need to be follow by a number (1 = 1.0 = 1.)
    <br>Variables can be used to refer to themselves e.x. "days = days - 1", and we evaluate the <b>right side first</b>! And, you can do this repeatedly
    <br>"=" is not an equals symbol, it means "assignment"" or an arrow</p> 
  <p>Strings through Experimenting with Strings Quiz (Python and more notes <a href="strings.py">here</a>, including quiz questions and answers)
    <br>A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes, e.x. "I am a string" or 'I am a string' (single or double quotes, either work), "I'm a string" also works
    <br>Convention says variables should be lowercase! (Not a Python rule)
    <br>+ operator in strings leads to concatenation, must manually add spaces
    <br>Can't concatenate strings and numbers, e.x. "print 'My name is ' + 9"</p>

<h2 class="Date">10/7/2016</h2>
  <p>Resuming @ Strings and Numbers
    <br>You can't add numbers and strings together, but you can multiply strings, e.x. "print 'Hello ' + 'Dave ' + '!' * 3"</p>
  <p>Experimenting with Strings Quiz
    <br>print 4 + 4 and print "4" + "4" return different things! (i.e. 8 vs 44)
    <br>String indexing lets you select individual characters in the string</p>
  <p>Indexing Strings (more <a href="indexing_strings.py">here</a>)
    <br>extract subsequences
    <br>string[expression] e.x. 'udacity'[0] returns 0th character, or u
    <br>expression can be anything that evaluates to a number, e.x. 1 + 1
    <br>more common to use variable, not a string:
      <p>name = 'Dave''
        <br>name[2] will return v</p>
    <br>Can use negative number, starts counting from back of string, [-1] will give last character, etc.</p>
  <p>Selecting Subsequences
    <br>string[expression1:expression2]
    <br>will evaluate to a string that is a subset of the original string starting from index expression1 and ending at index expression2 (non-inclusive, i.e characters expression1 through expression2 - 1)
    <br>leaving either side of the : blank will start at either the beginning [:4] or go through the end [3:], this way you don't actually need to know how long the string is!
    <br>s[0:0] will give an empty string
    <br>You can index positions that don't exist in this way!</p>

<h2 class="Date">10/8/2016</h2>
  <p>Resuming @ Finding Strings in Strings (more <a href="finding_strings.py">here</a>)
    <br>'find' method, built in procedure provided by Python, operates on strings:
    <br>string.find(string)
    <br>output is position where that substring is found (first occurrence) as a number, i.e. where in target string the search string is found
    <br>If target string is not found, the output will be -1
    <br>Note that Python is case sensitive!
    <br>According to Python, every string begins with an empty string (?)
    <br>'<b>parameters</b>' are what go inside parentheses</p>
  <p>To find other occurrences, pass a second parameter:
    <br>my_string = "hello, hello"
    <br>print my_string.find('h') should return 0 for the first occurrence
    <br>print my_string.find('h', 1) should return 7
    <br><em>Note that 1 tells find what position to begin search, in the above string 1 refers to the first e, not the first occurence of 'h'</em></p>
    <p>for the same string as above
      <br>print my_string.find('e') should return 1
      <br>print my_string.find('e', 3) should return 8 because it started looking for 'e' at the second l</p>
  <p><b>Work Session 2</b>
    <br>See .py above
    <br>Continues at Variables 1 in <a href="variables1.py">this</a> file</p>
    <p>Replacing Strings</p>
      <br>The method replace() returns a copy of the string in which the occurrences of old have been replaced with new, optionally restricting the number of replacements to max
      <br>Like this: str.replace(old, new[, max])
      <br>More simply: test_string.replace(old, new)
      <p>An example:
        <br>sentence = "I am a NOUN"
        <br>print sentence.replace("NOUN", "bird")</p>
      <p>Replace method allows us achieve the same outcome as slice and concatenate, but much more simply!</p>
