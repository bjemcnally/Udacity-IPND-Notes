  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Intro: Code Your Own Quiz</h3>
    <p>Concepts, Tools, and setting up workspace...</p>
    <p>Being comfortable makes everything easier and more efficient</p>
    <p>This program uses Python 2</p>
    <p>Re-installed Python 2.7 to make sure I have everything set properly for this course</p>
    <p>To use <b>Code Runner</b> in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), press Control+Alt+N, to stop running code press Control+Alt+M</p>
    <p>Use # symbol to add notes in Python</p>
    <p>Get in habit of running code this way!</p>
    <p><b>Git Bash</b>
      <br>MinTTY requires command line to be written like this:</p>
      <div class="CodeParent">
        <div class="CodeLeft">
          $ <b>winpty</b> python file_name.py
        </div>
        <div class="CodeRight">
          <b>Don't forget this!!</b>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Also: Windows users need to use <span class="inline_code">start</span> command instead of <span class="inline_code">open</span> to open a file in its default program.</p>
    <p><b>Graphical User Interface (GUI or "gwee")</b> - visual way of interacting with computer with windows, buttons, mouse, etc.</p>
    <p><b>Command Line Interface (CLI)</b> - e.x. Terminal, Git Bash, Powershell, etc.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><span class="inline_code">pwd</span> = print working directory</b>, "where am I?", will print out path to current directory (what GUI calls a folder)
        <br>When CLI is first opened it starts in the <b>home directory</b> (in my case this is C:/Users/bjerickson)</li>
      <li><span class="inline_code">ls</span> = list, helps us view the contents of a directory</li>
      <li><span class="inline_code">start</span>, use <span class="inline_code">start .</span> to view current directory's contents in a window, or use <span class="inline_code">start directory_name</span> to open another directory (folder)</li>
      <li><span class="inline_code">cd</span> = change directories, used to "move" somewhere else, <span class="inline_code">cd Desktop</span> will move to Desktop directory (folder) if it's within current directory, <span class="inline_code">cd ..</span> will move up one directory, <span class="inline_code">cd</span> will return to home directory, <span class="inline_code">cd FolderA/FolderAb/FolderAbC</span> can accomplish several steps at once (this is referred to as "chaining" the directories together)</li>
      <li><span class="inline_code">mkdir</span> = make directory ("make-dur" or "make-deer"), creates a new folder with the name we provide: <span class="inline_code">mk dir animals</span> will make new folder called animals
        <br>to make folder "rodents" inside of "animals":
        <br> cd into animals than mkdir rodents
        <br>OR from Desktop, "mkdir animals/rodents"
        <p>to make several new directories, separate them with a space: <span class="inline_code">mkdir cats dogs marsupials</span>
          <br>for this reason, <b>it is not a good idea to put spaces in your directory or filenames!!</b></p></li>
      <li><span class="inline_code">touch</span><, creates new files in one step, ex <span class="inline_code">touch first_file.txt</span> will create brand new, empty text file, you can verify that it was made using <span class="inline_code">ls</span>, can make a file in a directory other than current directory by specifying filepath (as with <span class="inline_code">ls</span>ls and <span class="inline_code">cd</span>), and to create multiple files separate with spaces (as with <span class="inline_code">mkdir</span>)</li>
      <li><span class="inline_code">rm</span> is used to delete a file completely (not move it to the trash), can delete multiple files by separating names with spaces as before</li>
      <li>There are two ways to remove directories:
        <br><span class="inline_code">rmdir</span>, <span class="inline_code">rmdir directory_name</span> deletes a directory, but only works if it's empty
        <br><span class="inline_code">rm -rf</span><b> (be careful with this one!), deletes a non-empty directory where -rf = recursive force, this is potentially very dangerous!!!!!!!</b></li>
      <li><b>Remember that to run a Python file in Git Bash you must include winpty:</b>
            <span class="inline_code">winpty python file_name.py</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A summary of these new commands can be found <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345403/modules/356813882475460/lessons/4137319262/concepts/63975772210923">here</a>.</p>
   <p>From here on, workspace = browser, code editor, and terminal (Git Bash or other)</p>
   <p>We will make a MadLibs games</p>
   <p>Learn to use "variables", to write "functions", and to think like a programmer</p>
   <p>Using Lessons 2.1-2.7 and the subsequent Work Session</p>
   <p><b>From here on, instead of naming each subsection individually, I will name the larger sections and just link directly to parts that are tricky or that I may need to review</b></p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Introduction to Serious Programming</h3>
    <p>Computer Science is about how to solve problems via a precise set of steps
      <br>"Crawling webpages" finds data, starts from "seed" page to find links to other pages which can themselves have links to other pages, etc.</p>
    <p><b>What is programming?</b> the core of computer science, to change a toaster's behavior you'd have to mechanically alter it, computers can't do anything without a program, it tells the computer what to do (and it can do any computation!), program must be a very precise sequence of steps, but computer can exute those steps VERY quickly</p>
    <p><b>Python</b>, named for Monty Python, high level language, Python code runs via Python program (interpreter)</p>
    <p><b>Remember that Control+Alt+N will run code in VS Code</b></p>
    <p>Took notes for <b>First Programming Quiz</b> in Python file which can be viewed <a href="first-programming-quiz.py">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Why do we need to invent new languages to program computers instead of using natural languages (like English or Mandarin)?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ambiguity in natural languages (e.x. biweekly can mean every other week AND twice a week = ambiguous!)</li>
        <li>Verbosity, code minimizes number of necessary characters</li>
      </ul>
    <p>getting a syntax error indicates that your script contains something that is not part of the python language</p>
    <p><b>Grammar</b> (more notes on this section can be found <a href="grammar.py">here</a>)
      <br>English: sentence = subject, verb, object
      <br>subject and object can be nouns, etc
      <br>Languages have rules and parts of speech, etc</p>
    <p><b>Backus Naur Form</b>
      <br>precisely describe language in simple and concise way
      <br>Non-terminal --> replacement
      <br>replacement can be non-terminal or terminal and you keep replacing until you reach terminals:
      <br>Sentence --> Subject Verb Object
      <br>Subject --> Noun
      <br>Object --> Noun
      <br>Verb --> Eat
      <br>Verb --> Like
      <br>Noun --> I
      <br>Noun --> Python
      <br>Noun --> Cookies</p>
    <p><b>Derivation</b> starts from non-terminal and follows rules until we have only terminals left
      <br>Valid outputs for above include: "I Eat Cookies" and "Python Like Python", etc.</p>
    <p>Python grammar is much stricter than most natural language grammars
      <br>Code must match language grammar exactly (see <a href="python-expression.py">here</a> for an example of bad Python grammar)</p>
    <p>Python Grammar for Arithmetic Expression:
      <br>Expression --> Expression Operator Expression (recursive definition, resulting in an infinite number of possible outcomes/derivations)
      <br>Expression --> Number
      <br>Operator --> +
      <br>Operator --> *
      <br>Number --> 0, 1, ... etc
      <br>Expression --> (Expression)
      <br>An example derivation can result in: 1 + 1 and/or replacing expressions with expressions can increase complexity infinitely!
      <br>A few simple rules (like above) can be used to describe a big language!</p>
    <p>Speed of Light Quiz (associated Python <a href="speed-of-light.py">here</a>)
      <br>Write Python code to print out how far light travels in cm in one nanosecond...
      <br>For one billion (1,000,000,000) or whatever, Python does not allow spaces (1 000 000 000) or the commas, must use 1000000000
      <br>Note: if all numbers provided are integers Python will return an integer, to get decimals include at least one decimal place in your calculation (1.0 vs just 1)</p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Work Session 1</h3>
    <p>Debugging practice: Notes
      <br><span class="inline_code">print 1</span> is valid
      <br><span class="inline_code">&nbsp;print 1</span> (leading space) is NOT valid
      <br>Python will interpret <span class="inline_code">print &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</span> the same as <span class="inline_code">print 1</span>
      <br><span class="inline_code">Print 1</span> (capital P) is NOT valid
      <br>Takeaway: <em>the trick to dealing with mistakes in code ("bugs") is not to avoid making them entirely, but to develop a system for finding and fixing them!</em></p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Variables and Strings</h3>
    <p>Where to Focus Your Attention</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is a variable?</li>
        <li>What does it mean to assign a value to a variable</li>
        <li>What is the difference between = in math versus programming? i.e. what is the difference between 2 + 3 = 5 and my_variable = 5?</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Variables and Varying Variables (Python and more notes <a href="variables.py">here</a>, including quiz questions and answers)
      <br>Assignment statement: Name = Expression
      <br>Name can be any sequence of letters, numbers, and underscores
      <br>Variables can vary, you can change their value!
      <br>When including a decimal, it does not need to be follow by a number (1 = 1.0 = 1.)
      <br>Variables can be used to refer to themselves e.x. , and we evaluate the <b>right side first</b>! And, you can do this repeatedly
      <br><span class="inline_code">=</span> is not an equals symbol, it means "assignment" or an arrow</p> 
    <p>Strings through Experimenting with Strings Quiz (Python and more notes <a href="strings.py">here</a>, including quiz questions and answers)
      <br>A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes, e.x. <span class="inline_code">"I am a string"</span> or <span class="inline_code">'I am a string'</span> (single or double quotes, either work), <span class="inline_code">"I'm a string"</span> also works
      <br>Convention says variables should be lowercase! (not a Python rule)
      <br><span class="inline_code">+</span> operator in strings leads to concatenation, must manually add spaces
      <br>Can't concatenate strings and numbers, e.x. <span class="inline_code">print 'My name is ' + 9</span></p>

    <p>You can't add numbers and strings together (above), but you can multiply strings
      <br>e.x. <span class="inline_code">print 'Hello ' + 'Dave ' + '!' * 3</span></p>
    <p>Experimenting with Strings Quiz
      <br><span class="inline_code">print 4 + 4</span> and <span class="inline_code">print "4" + "4"</span> return different things! (i.e. 8 vs 44)</p>
    <p>Indexing Strings (more <a href="indexing_strings.py">here</a>)
      <br>String indexing lets you select individual characters in the string or extract subsequences
      <br>string[expression] e.x. <span class="inline_code">'udacity'[0]</span returns 0th character, or u
      <br>expression can be anything that evaluates to a number, e.x. 1 + 1
      <br>more common to use variable, not a string:</p>
      <div class="CodeParent">
        <div class="CodeLeft">
          <p>name = 'Dave''
          <br>name[2] </p>
        </div>
        <div class="CodeRight">
          <p>will return v</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Can use negative number, starts counting from back of string, [-1] will give last character, etc.</p>
  <p>Selecting Subsequences
    <br><span class="inline_code">string[expression1:expression2]</span>
    <br>will evaluate to a string that is a subset of the original string starting from index expression1 and ending at index expression2 (<em>non-inclusive</em>, i.e characters expression1 through expression2 - 1)
    <br>leaving either side of the : blank will start at either the beginning [:4] or go through the end [3:], this way you don't actually need to know how long the string is!
    <br>s[0:0] will give an empty string
    <br>You can index positions that don't exist in this way!</p>

    <p>Finding Strings in Strings (more <a href="finding_strings.py">here</a>)
      <br>'<b>find</b>' method, built in procedure provided by Python, operates on strings:
      <br><span class="inline_code">string.find(string)</span>
      <br>output is position where that substring is found (first occurrence) as a number, i.e. where in target string the search string is found
      <br>If target string is not found, the output will be -1
      <br>Note that Python is case sensitive!
      <br>According to Python, every string begins with an empty string (?)
      <br>'<b>parameters</b>' are what go inside parentheses</p>
    <p>To find other occurrences, pass a second parameter:</p>
      <div class="CodeParent">
        <div class="CodeLeft">
          <p>my_string = "hello, hello"
          <br>print my_string.find('h')
          <br>print my_string.find('h', 1)
          <br>print my_string.find('e')
          <br>print my_string.find('e', 3)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="CodeRight">
          <p>Should return 0 for the first occurrence of 'h'
          <br>the second should return 7
          <br>third should return 1
          <br>last should return 8 because it started looking for 'e' at the second l</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p><em>Note that 1 tells find what position to begin search, in the above string 1 refers to the first e, not the first occurence of 'h'</em></p>

    <p>See .py above
      <br>Continues at Variables 1 in <a href="variables1.py">this</a> file</p>
    <p>Replacing Strings</p>
      <br>The method <span class="inline_code">replace()</span> returns a copy of the string in which the occurrences of old have been replaced with new, optionally restricting the number of replacements to max
      <br>Like this: <span class="inline_code">str.replace(old, new[, max])</span>
      <br>More simply: <span class="inline_code">test_string.replace(old, new)</span>
      <p>An example:</p>
        <div class="CodeParent">
          <div class="CodeLeft">
            <p>sentence = "I am a NOUN"
            <br>print sentence.replace("NOUN", "bird")</p>
          </div>
          <div class="CodeRight">
            <p>Replace method allows us achieve the same outcome as slice and concatenate, but much more simply!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Input --> Function --> Output</h3>
    <p>functions (aka "procedures")
    <br>Simple example:</p>
    <div class="Code">
      <p>def say_hello(name):
      <br>greeting = "Hello " + name + "!"
      <br>return greeting</p>
      <p>print say_hello("Miriam")
      <br>print say_hello("Andy")</p>
    </div>
    <p>Above 'name' is a <b>parameter</b> of the <b>function</b> say_hello</p>
    <p>functions have '<b>inputs</b>' and '<b>outputs</b>'</p>
    <p>Focus checkpoint, we want to understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what a function is</li>
        <li>how to make one</li>
        <li>how to use one</li>
        <li>when to use one</li>
        <li>why they are valuable</li>
      </ul>
    <p><span class="inline_code">def</span> and <span class="inline_code">return</span> are important components!</p>
    <p><b>Using Functions</b> (related .py <a href="procedures.py">here</a>)
    <br><span class="inline_code">function(input1, input2)</span>
    <br>'inputs' aka '<b>operands</b>' or '<b>arguments</b>'
    <br>return determines the output of the function</p>
    <div class="CodeParent">
      <div class="CodeLeft">
        <p>def rest_of_string(s):
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return s[1:]</p>
        <p>print rest_of_string('audacity')</p>
      </div>
      <div class="CodeRight">
        <p>Interpreter will run code defined within the function and assign to function parameters that values passed as input (in this case the string 'audacity'), i.e. now s = 'audacity'
        <br><span class="inline_code">return</span> jumps us back to where we called the function
        <br>output = 'udacity'</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>procedures <em>map inputs to outputs</em></p>
    <p>Notice the differences between how functions are defined vs used (or 'called):
      <br><span class="inline_code">def rest_of_strings(s):</span> versus <span class="inline_code">print rest_of_string("audacity")</span>
      <br>s is a parameter of our function and audacity is a value passed as input to that function</p>
      <p>Number of inputs must match the number of parameters the function expects</p>
      <p><span class="inline_code">find()</span> method is an example of a function defined in Python
      <br>It has an additional input compared to functions you define yourself (i.e. 'input1' below) and has a set number of inputs as defined in Python
      <br><span class="inline_code">input1.find(input2, input3)</span></p>

    <p>Resuming @ Sum Procedure Quiz (relevant .py <a href="sum.py">here</a>)</p>
    <p>without <span class="inline_code">return</span>, functions do not produce any output</p>
    <p>adding <span class="inline_code">print</span> statements can help with debugging code</p>
    
    <div class="InterestingNotes">
      <p>The following are notes from the <a href="https://discussions.udacity.com/t/stage-2-webcasts/16001/6">transcript</a> of a Python Basics live event</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"When you define a function, any variables which are created inside of the function are destroyed when the function ends" = <b>local scope</b></li>
        <li>This is different from <b>global scope</b>, i.e. a variable defined outside of any function
        <div class="CodeParent">
          <div class="CodeLeft">
            <p>a = 0</p>
            <p>def some_function():
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;a = 5
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print "Function: " + str(a)</p>
            <p>some_function()
            <br>print "Global: " + str(a)</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "CodeRight">
            <p>a = 0 defines a variable and, despite what occurs inside the function, the global definition of a is unchanged!</p>
          </div>
        </div></li>
        <li><b>mutable</b> value is one that can be altered (i.e. sets, lists, dictionaries), you can change the value that is being pointed to without changing the pointer</li>
        <li><b>immutable</b> value is changed by pointing to a new value</li>
        <li>"if we want an immutable value back from a function, <span class="inline_code">return</span> the value!"</li>
        <li>"<span class="inline_code">return</span> will return the result of a function so it can be used <em>outside</em> of that function"</li>
        <li>Good Python style:  indent with either 2 or 4 spaces (just be consistent!), name variables or functions with regard to their content so you don't need to add as many comments, comments should explain how/why a particular section was coded!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <p><b>Learn More: Problem Solving</b></p>
      <p>When solving problems in Python, identify the inputs and outputs, identify how to get from input to output, then code!</p>
      <p>These problems are way beyond anything we have covered so far! Come back to them later...</p>
      <p><b>Square Quiz</b> (<a href="square.py">relevant .py</a>)</p>
      <p><b>Procedure composition</b> - use the output of one procedure (function) as the input of another!</p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Work Session 3 (<a href="udacify.py">relevant .py</a>)</h3>
    <p>Keep in mind the following when setting up functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>must begin with <span class="inline_code">def</span></li>
      <li>followed by the functions' name</li>
      <li>then a set of parentheses with the parameters inside</li>
      <li>the first line must end with a <span class="inline_code">:</span> colon</li>
      <li>within the function, every line must be indented</li>
      <li>and... in order for it to produce an output, it must end with a <span class="inline_code">return</span> statement</li>
      <li>to call a function: <span class="inline_code">function_name(parameter1, parameter2, etc)</span></li>
      <li>finally, must include a print statement to view the output!</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Print vs Return Quiz</b></p>
      <p>If <span class="inline_code">print</span> statement is <em>before</em> <span class="inline_code">return</span> statement, the <span class="inline_code">print</span> will never be executed!

        <p><b>Using just arithmetic, comparisons, functions, and <span class="inline_code">if</span> statements we now know enough (in theory) to write every possible computer program!</b>
        <br>However, there are more powerful constructs that will let us do what we want with less code and more elegantly</p>
       
        <p><b>While Loops</b> (<a href="while.py">relevant .py</a> starting here)</p>
        <p>Loops, way to do things over and over</p>
        <p><span class="inline_code">while</span> loop: </p>
          <div class="Code">
            <p>while expression: 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;block</p>
          </div>
        <p>As we saw with <span class="inline_code">if</span> statements, the block is a set of instructions
        <br>with <span class="inline_code">if</span> the block evaluates either 0 or 1 times depending on whether the test expression is <span class="inline_code">True</span>
        <br>with <span class="inline_code">while</span> the block continues to be evaluated as long as the test expression ('expression' above) is <span class="inline_code">True</span></p>
        <p>A simple example:</p>
        <div class="Code">
          <p>i = 0
          <br>while i < 10:
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print i
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i + 1</p>
        </div>
        <p>Important to note: after this loop, the new value of i is 10! While loop does not require a <span class="inline_code">return</span> statement!</p>

        <p><b>Break Statements</b>
        <br><span class="inline_code">break</span> gives us a way to stop the loop while the test conditions are <span class="inline_code">True</span>, it tells to interpreter to jump out of the while loop and continue with any code that comes next</p>
        <p>A simple example:</p>
        <div class="Code">
          <p>while test_expression:
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Python code goes here
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if break_test:
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break</p>
        </div>
        <p>As soon as break test is <span class="inline_code">True</span> we exit the loop</p>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Debugging (<a href="debugging.py">relevant .py</a>)</h3>
    <p><b>Bugs Happen!</b>
    <br>Bugs are inevitable! Develop a strategy for getting rid of them.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the bug causes the program to crash, in this case Python will give you a '<b>traceback</b>' error, this will tell you where it crashed, including line number and function name, even if the error is not on that line, it <em>is</em> somewhere upstream from there</p>
    <p>You can always Google the error message! e.x. <span class="inline_code">TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'</span>
      <br>in this case, you can't concatenate a number and a string, so you must use the <span class="inline_code">str()</span> function to 'stringify' the number (see .py)</p>
    <p>When learning a new feature or language, you will often start with example code and then change it to do what you want it to</p>
    <p>If that doesn't work...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>'comment out' your code</li>
        <li>copy and paste the example code</li>
        <li>run it to make sure the example does what it should</li>
        <li>then modify in small steps until it does what you wanted</li>
        <li>then compare to your original code to see if you can find the bug</li>
      </ul>
    <p>All example code is not created equal! Sometimes it contains its own bugs and other times there are simply better examples to work from!</p>
    <p>Bugs don't always cause programs to crash, these can be trickier to deal with!</p>
    <p>If a function calculates an incorrect value, you often need to break it up into smaller pieces to find where it went wrong</p>
    <p>One easy way to do this is to introduce <span class="inline_code">print</span> statements that output the variables where you can see them to check for weirdness</p>
    <p><b>Keep and Compare Old Versions!</b>
      <br>Comment out old version with hash mark (#) or turn it into a big string by putting ''' (triple quotes) around it, this is called a '<b>docstring</b>' which is a multiline string (use either # or ''' and be consistent!)</p>
    <p>Or copy code to different file and save it for your reference</p>
    <p>Keeping old versions is useful when you ask for help because you can show 2-3 different things that you've tried</p>
    <p>Version control systems like Git make this even easier</p>
    <p><b>Debugging Recap</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Examine error messages</li>
        <li>Work from example code</li>
        <li>Make sure examples work</li>
        <li>Check (print) intermediate results</li>
        <li>Keep and compare old versions</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Debugging isn't just finding and correcting errors, it is a really important skill and scientific process (i.e. it uses the scientific method!) Udacity has an entire course dedicated to debugging!</p>
    <p>Comments are helpful because they allow you to compare what the code should be doing with what it actually does (i.e. it is a good idea to put the 'should' in comments as you go)</p>
    <p><b>Commenting tips:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't comment 'obvious code' (i.e. code that is self explanatory)</li>
        <li>Start functions with a comment, e.x.:
          <div class="Code">
            <p>def isLeapYear(year):
            <br><em># takes a number as input and outputs True if the number
            <br># represents a leap year and False otherwise</em></p>
          </div></li>
        <li>Keep comments up-to-date, change them as your code changes</li>
        <li>Be concise</li>
      </ul>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">Structured Data: Lists and For Loops (<a href="structured.py">relevant .py</a>)</h3>
  <p>"strings" are a type of structured data, we can break them down into individual characters and operate on subsequences</p>
  <p><b>Lists</b> can be sequence of anything: characters, strings, numbers, lists, etc. AND a combination of any of those</p>

  <p>Example string, s: <span class="inline_code">s = 'yabba!'</span>, i.e. identified using quotes
  <br>We can index an individual character: <span class="inline_code">s[0]</span>, i.e. 'y'
  <br>Use colon inside square brackets to select substring: <span class="inline_code">s[2:4]</span>, i.e. 'bb' a string
  </p>

  <p>Example list, p: <span class="inline_code">p = ['y','a','b','b','a','!']</span>, i.e. identified using square brackets ([]) where individual elements are separated by commas
  <br>We can access list elements in a similar way: <span class="inline_code">p[0]</span>, i.e. 'y'
  <br>Similar for lists: <span class="inline_code">p[2:4]</span>, i.e. ['b','b']. Notice that instead of a string, this returns a 'sub-list' with just those elements
  </p>

  <p>Lists can have 0, 1, or any number of elements and can even contain other lists</p>

  <p>When you <span class="inline_code">print</span> a list, the whole thing is printed, including the brackets, quotes, and commas</p>

  <p>Lists are ordered!</p>

  <p>If you have a list of lists ('<b>nested list</b>'), you can access the individual lists AND elements in each list</p>

  <p>Example nested list: <span class="inline_code">mixed_up = ['apple', 3, 'oranges',27,[1,2,['alpha','beta']]]</span>, here the 5th element is a list that also contains a list</p>

  <p>Better, more useful example (Name, birth year): </p>
    <div class="CodeParent"> 
      <div class="CodeLeft">
        <p>beatles = [['John', 1940],['Paul', 1942],
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;['George', 1943], ['Ringo', 1940]]</p>
        <p>print beatles[3][0]</p>
      </div>
      <div class="CodeRight">
        <p>To make it clear to the Python interpreter that this is all one list, while breaking it up onto different lines for readability, insert the break after a comma and indent properly (as shown)</p>
        <p>This print statement will index the 1st element of the 4th element in the list <span class="inline_code">beatles</span>, i.e. Ringo</p>

    <p>New vocab words RE: Lists:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>mutation</b> - supported by lists and not strings, we can change the value of a list <em>after</em> we've created it!
        <p>For a string, concatenation does not change the string, it creates a whole new string:</p>
        <div class="Code">
          <p>s = 'Hello'
          <br>s = 'Yello'
          <br>s = s + 'w'</p>
        </div>
        <p>For lists:
        <div class="Code">
          <p>p = ['H','e','l','l','o']
          <br>p = ['Y','e','l','l','o'] # creates a new list
          <br>p[0] = 'Y' # <b>mutates</b> an element to a new value!</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you introduce a new variable and then mutate it, it changes the value of BOTH lists (following from above):
        <div class="Code">
          <p>q = p
          <br>q[4] = '!'</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now <span class="inline_code">q = p = ['Y','e','l','l','!']</span></p>
        <p>In other words: strings are not mutable! You can not change their value</p>
        <p>If an object is mutable, we have to worry about other variables that might refer to the same object (e.x. q and p above and in .py)</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>aliasing</b> - two different ways to refer to the same object
        <p>e.x. James Bond and 007 refer to the same person, if something happens to James Bond, it affects the state of both James Bond and 007</p>
        <p>If we have two variables names refering to the same object, changes to one change <b>both</b>!</p>
        <div class="Code">
          <p>p = ['J','a','m','e','s']
          <br> p = q
          <br>p[2] = 'n' # this changes the value of both p AND q
          <br>p = [0,0,7] # this also changes the value of both</p>
        </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When using a function the parameter and input are (at least temporarily) aliases:</p>
      <div class="Code">
        <p>def replace_spy(p):
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;p[2] = p[2] + 1</p>
        <p>spy = [0,0,7]
        <br>replace_spy(spy)
        <br>print spy</p>
      </div>
      <p>In this example <span class="inline_code">p</span> and <span class="inline_code">spy</span> refer to the same object inside the function</p>
      <p>This is different from the following function:</p>
      <div class="Code">
        <p>def inc(n):
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;n = n + 1
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return n</p>
      </div>
      <p>Removing the <span class="inline_code">return</span> statement from <span class="inline_code">inc</span> does not change the value of the input, only (temporarily) changes the value of <span class="inline_code">n</span> inside the function</p>
      <p>Numbers are immutable!</p>
      
      <p><b>List Operations (new <a href="list_operations.py">relevant .py</a>)</b>
      <br>Using lists we can build very complex data structures and do lots of interesting things!</p>
      <p><span class="inline_code">list_name.append(new_element)</span> - is a method for lists that adds a new element to the end of our list, it mutates the list that it is envoked on, <em>it does not create a new list!</em></p>
      <p><span class="inline_code">list1 + list2</span> - plus sign here operates like concatenation for strings, it does not change either list, it generates a new list!</p>
      <p><span class="inline_code">len(list)</span> - gives the length of any object (lists, strings, etc.), output is the number of elements (or characters in a string)
      <br>e.x. <span class="inline_code">len([0,1])</span> is 2</p>
      <p><span class="inline_code">len</span> only counts the outer elements so if you have a list of lists, it counts the number of children lists in the parent list, not the total number of elements in the children lists</p>

      <p><b>For Loops</b>
      <br><span class="inline_code">for</span> allows us to loop through lists in more targeted manner than <span class="inline_code">while</span></p>

      <p>General structure:</p>
      <div class="Code">
        <p>for name in list:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;block</p>
      </div>
      <p>Above name is a variable, for each element in the list we assign an element to the name then do something with them, e.x.</p>
      <div class="Code">
        <p>def print_all_elements(p):
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for e in p:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print e</p>
        <p>my_list = [1,2,[3,4]]
        <br>print_all_elements(my_list)</p>
      </div>
      <p>The above will print each element in the input list on a separate line</p>

      <p><b>Index Method (<a href="find_element.py">relevant .py</a>)</b>
      <br>General syntax <span class="inline_code">list.index(value)</span>, where the output is the position where that value exists in the list</p>
      <p>unlike <span class="inline_code">find()</span>, if the value does not exist <span class="inline_code">index()</span> returns an error instead of -1</p>
      <p><span class="inline_code">index()</span> returns the location of the <em>first</em> incidence of the search value</p>

      <p><span class="inline_code">in</span> method, e.x. <span class="inline_code">value in list</span>, if the value is not found, <span class="inline_code">in</span> returns <span class="inline_code">False</span>, if it is found it returns <span class="inline_code">True</span></p>

      <p><span class="inline_code">not in</span> method, e.x. <span class="inline_code">value not in list</span> works in the same way</p>

      <p>In the example we practiced, we used <span class="inline_code">index()</span> within an <span class="inline_code">if</span> statement</p>

        <p>Notes from another "Learn More" session <a href="http://discussions.udacity.com/t/stage-2-webcasts/16001/5">transcript</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a good example of a <span class="inline_code">while</span> loop:
          <div class="Code">
            <p>count = 0
            <br>while count < n:
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;do something...
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;count += 1</p>
          </div>
          <p>It is highly recommended that whenever you code a <span class="inline_code">while</span> loop we first set up the structure and make sure our count variable increases in value, this will help us avoid infinite loops!</p></li>
          <li>In contrast, <span class="inline_code">for</span> loops automatically stop when they reach the end of their assigned list</li>
          <li><span class="inline_code">range()</span> function can take a number and return a list of values increasing from 0 to that number, exclusive, e.x. <span class="inline_code">print range(11)</span> returns a [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] <b>not including 11</b></li>
        </ul>

  <h3 class="NotesTitle">How to Solve Problems (<a href="how_to_solve.py">relevant .py</a>)</h3>
  <p><b>Understanding a Problem...</b>
  <br>means understanding the relationship between possible inputs and desired outputs</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the inputs?
      <p>This may require <b>defensive programming</b>, in the example this would mean checking to make sure that the second date is not before the first date (that one can not be negative days old!)</p></li>
    <li>What are the outputs?</li>
    <li>Work through some examples by hand
      <p>It may help to start by working out examples and intermediate steps, even starting on paper if necessary and thinking through the prboblem systematically</p>
      <p>This might include thinking about what to do with invalid inputs</p></li>
    <li>Come up with a simple mechanical solution
      <p>It may be helpful to write out "<b>pseudocode</b>", just work out the idea and see if it makes sense in English, e.x. (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm">Wikipedia</a>
        <br>if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
        <br>else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
        <br>else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
        <br>else (it is a leap year)</p>
      <p>Sometimes the way humans solve problems is <em>NOT</em> the simplest way!</p>
      <p>e.x. Instead of adding days + length of months , etc... I might be simpler to just write code to count days!</p></li>
    <li>Don't optimize prematurely! Start with finding a simple and correct solution! Getting approximate answers at first is always a great confidence booster.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="Code">
    <p>def nextDay(year, month, day):
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if day < 30:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return year, month, day + 1</p>
  </div>
  <p>The above was included to remind me that I learned that you can add to a tuple! (a finite ordered list of elements, in this case parameters to a particular function)</p>
